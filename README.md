###This software was NOT created by myself, the original link is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zUCPVBnhPvb6HjfCoyrH85bQMs6s-aLJ

###The purpose of creating this repo is to ensure the enviroment is more easily reproduced for troubleshooting purposes and to include all necesary dependencies (python needs to be installed first). Just run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the project directory to install all dependencies.
